I was writing down the Readme, but I couldn't set the path to the repository.
All the repositories were blown away.
So I found a way.
1. Create a new repository.
2. Cloning the repository locally.
3. Copy my local programming file and insert it into the cloned folder.
4. Staging, committing anew, and starting full push synchronization because the path has changed.
I've done what I've learned.
