<!-- 작업 끝날 때마다 SHIFT+ALT+F를 눌러서 소스코드 줄을 정렬하자 -->


<!-- The document format is SHIFT+ALT+F. Line-up source format should be well aligned. In practice, it is very important for language to indent and be good at code characters.
There are always new scrolls, but there are few horizontal scrolls. It should be saved so that it does not scroll properly by formatting the code.
@@@Ctrl+Space@@@@@@@@@@@@@.
Typing is important for coding. Fast speed is important. Fast typing is not important. Visual Studio copies everything. Computers don't allow typos.
It is not done efficiently, but made using Ctrl+Space.
The font family prioritizes writing in English. But if we don't know it, we can do it in Korean or google it. We need to improve the information by typing Korean alphabetical English names on Google.
Type the English name of the roll and write it in the code source.

In the syl, margin means external and padding means internal. If the same content exists, select h1 and h2.
ID selectors and track selectors are frequently used.
When you fly the CSS source of the web page, a RAW output screen pops up. If CSS processing is slow, this screen can be seen.
When clearing the source code, there is a function that allows the source to erase one line by pressing SHIFT and pressing DEL. We need to maximize efficiency (we need to be able to do a lot of things in a short time).
Press SHIFT+ALT and press the direction key to copy the source code and go down.
If the same ID is duplicated in the folder, there is no error.
If you put a style in the head, you can handle the inner style. If C# makes an error, nothing can be done at all. It's not good because it's a car. It is so comfortable to use that it can be operated even if there is an error.(Work should be done to avoid this error.)
You have to copy and paste to avoid typos.
Width: 800px;800 pixels. If you go to a mobile like Android, you can use a different kind. The optimization color is an industry rule to float a space when it is easy, and it automatically floats when it is written down.
margin: 0 auto;(auto) means central alignment (same as ground picking game).)
overflow: hidden;( It hides unnecessary parts on the screen.)
Components for creating blogs

There are many @@code sort plug-ins.In the @@ search, press beauty to set it. Plug-ins are used because they are required and efficient by users.
It changes to make the menu I'm writing to the left and right. The only thing that's designed is what made what we do dynamic. It's not an incredibly difficult coding.
In design, all folders are preferred to be tightly aligned.

Class selector id does not allow duplicate writes. If you put it in multiple times, it will be very troublesome. However, the class allows for redundancy. We solve what we allow in duplicate through class selection.
Classes can be written several times.

In one HTML, one head and body can only be used once. --> -->

<!-- <br> stands for break line.
Input form tags are the most commonly used.
There are many things to choose from as a task in the smart factory. So I use a lot of drop-down tags.
The spatial segmentation tag uses div. Div is the division of space.
If you use nav or header well, developers are comfortable. You can also ask acronyms for fast HTML.(HyperText Mark Language)
It is very advantageous to memorize the full terminology of the company you are applying for at the interview.
CSS is to do elements for design visualization.
The selector is called SELECTER. Organization has a parent class and a child class. Every computer has its own contents, parents and children.
The body belongs to the parents, and the descendants belong to the ul. The descendants belong to it. Foreigners wrote it from the beginning and we wrote it accordingly."
You must select a specific HTML source. The meaning of choosing something is called the h1 tag. There are fewer tags, but other values may be less.
The values for the properties should be written in brackets.
Use astric when using all selectors.
ID stands for Unique and the only value. That's how you use your ID.
There is a difference between designer and programmer. The programmer tries to make it efficient and the designer tries to make it beautiful.
Designers work to make them look beautiful, even if they are inefficient, repetitive, and useless.
Among the selectors, the header differs from the header unit in HTML. It is different from the header that is sitting on the structure. The relationship between parents and h1 in the cement domain. It is not h1 in the section. The contents are complicated.
When a web does something, as well as the web, action or reaction occurs. The responses all change depending on our reaction. An active or deactive mouse hoisting in an area is called a hover. CSS work is essential for this.
If you raise your mouse, you'll react. When you check in the input, it is marked in the check box. When we raise or click the mouse, things change a lot. If you can't press the button while working, it is said to be disabled. (disabled) <->(abled) There are many things to study.
You can't play.
The choice between ul and ol is called the structure selector. I don't know anything else, but you must know the basic choice.
